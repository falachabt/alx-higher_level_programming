Python Import & Modules Project
This project covers various aspects of Python programming related to imports, modules, and command line arguments. The tasks include writing programs to import functions from files, perform mathematical operations, handle command line arguments, and explore module functionalities.

Files
0-add.py

Description: Imports the add function from the file add_0.py and prints the result of adding 1 + 2.
Usage: ./0-add.py
1-calculation.py

Description: Imports mathematical functions from calculator_1.py and performs calculations with values 10 and 5.
Usage: ./1-calculation.py
2-args.py

Description: Prints the number of command-line arguments and their values.
Usage: ./2-args.py [arg1] [arg2] ...
3-infinite_add.py

Description: Prints the result of the addition of all command-line arguments.
Usage: ./3-infinite_add.py [arg1] [arg2] ...
4-hidden_discovery.py

Description: Prints names defined in the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
Usage: ./4-hidden_discovery.py
5-variable_load.py

Description: Imports the variable a from variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
Usage: ./5-variable_load.py
Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment using Python 3.8.5
All files should end with a new line.
The first line of each file must be #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Code should adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All files must be executable.
File lengths will be tested using wc.
Learning Objectives
Understand the importance of Python programming.
Learn how to import functions from other files.
Explore the usage of imported functions.
Understand how to create a module.
Use the built-in function dir() to explore module content.
Prevent code from being executed when imported.
Work with command-line arguments in Python programs.
